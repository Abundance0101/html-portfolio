<h3>Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse & Across the Spider Verse</h3>
<p>It's Art and rythym is just stunning and the storyline is something we all can personally relate with</p>

<h3>Frozen 1 & 2</h3>
<p>The frozen series was epic, part two brought more light to the scene... <br /> from the stories in the past to the graphics to the music (epic)</p>

<h3>Attack On Titans</h3>
<p>One of the greatest Anime of all time... depicted reality in a unique way <br /> AOT has it's movies and series (I personally recommend the series, it  gives more details)</p>
